  I was a programer, work in HxxWxx.
  But I am not a formal worker, i am an OD. By the way, do you know what is OD?
Some of my workmate who is also OD said that, the meaning of OD is our dog.
In fact, OD is outsourcing dispatches.
  But... Ren was said that "The winter is comed". As a student who graduated in
a low colledge named ShaoGuan University. I do not have too much choice.
  OK. Now come back to my story.

  2023/5/6 saturday
  Because of the 5 day holiday of Labor Day, I have to work today.
The '5', is including 4/29(Sat), 4/30(Sun), 5/1, 5/2, 5/3. And 5/2 and 5/3 was borrowed
form 4/23(Sun) and 5/6(Sat).  And this is the regulation of rest named "time off in lieu",
one of the great inventions in my country. If they want, they can borrow all of weekends.

  Today, I have to work usuall. And I want to leave as usuall in 20:30.
  I was try to test the system environment was OK or not, and type the classic code as follow:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  cout<<"Hell World!"<<endl;
  return 0;
}

  Showed in cmd: "Hell World!"
  "en? Do i miss an o? Well, forget about that, I have to leave now. I don't want to work overtime in an overtime work" I think.
  When I standed up and I was shutdowned.

  When I wake up, I found that I was in company but there are something different.
